# Object Detection and Tracking with DeepSORT

## Project Brief Description

This project demonstrates the use of DeepSORT for object detection and tracking. It includes the necessary code to set up and run the detection model, project 3D LiDAR point clouds to 2D image space, and associate LiDAR depth with each detected object.

## Video Result

A video demonstration of the object detection and tracking process can be found below:
